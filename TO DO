- Create Advertisement packet and finish Client and router logic for advertising hostnames
- Create a way for Clients to request host names, and resolve IP addresses for a given name
- Automate wrapping of messages
- Ensure endpoints unwrap messages properly before reading them
- Look at implementing protocols


Points for Improvement:
Error Handling: Some areas like socket handling and packet transmission might be improved with more robust error handling and logging.

Packet Processing: The packet switching mechanism in the router is simplistic and could be expanded to handle more complex routing decisions (e.g., routing tables, dynamic IP address assignments).

Client Disconnection: The client disconnection handling in ClientHandler could be improved by properly managing the socket resources and notifying the router when a client disconnects.

Segment Integrity: The Segment class currently doesn't calculate or verify checksums, which could be added for packet integrity validation.
